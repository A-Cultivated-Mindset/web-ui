# PodcastIndex web and dev UI

This is the UI for the public and dev portal

## Getting Started

### Set .env

You should see a `.env-example` file. Copy this and remove the `-example`. The file `.env` is ignored by GIT and is needed to set the `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET` variables

### Starting the dev server

```zsh
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start app
yarn start
```

## Building for production
